        "header": "Taxpayers in the United States will face a steep bill if the Trump administration signs legislation to extend legal status to so-called \u201cDreamers,\u201d the illegal aliens who arrived as children and are now protected under the Obama-holdover unlawful executive order known as DACA.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "The cost of a legislation to legalize childhood arrivals is likely to be far higher than earlier attempts because of Obamacare\u2019s health insurance subsidies. The Affordable Care Act subsidizes the costs of health insurance for millions of Americans and would likely foot the bill for many of those whose residency in the U.S. would be legalized by the DREAM Act.",
            "The numbers are striking. The DREAM Act of 2017, the most likely vehicle for extending DACA protections and making them permanent, would raise federal outlays by $115 billion dollars, according to a Breitbart News analysis.\u00a0Nearly all of that would be paid for by additional deficit spending.",
            "That may come as a surprise to lawmakers. The last time the DREAM Act was seriously considered, the Congressional Budget Office said that the bill would reduce budget deficits by about $1.4 billion over the following decade. But that bill prohibited those it legalized from receiving subsidies toward health insurance until they became permanent legal residents after ten years, while the current version of the bill does not.",
            "The DREAM Act of 2017, sponsored by Democrat\u00a0Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, would extend legal residency and a path to citizenship for at least 3.3 million people, according to the Migration Policy Institute. These include 1.8 million illegal aliens who would be immediately eligible, plus 1.5 billion who would become eligible in the near future by doing things such as enrolling in school.",
            "Unlike the Senate DREAM bill from 2010 and Obama\u2019s DACA executive order, the current DREAM Act does not exclude those who benefit from the new immigration status from receiving health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Absent a specific exclusion, by granting so-called Dreamers status as \u201clawfully present\u201d in the United States, the new DREAM \u00a0Act would make millions both subject to the individual mandate to buy health insurance and potential beneficiaries of the subsidies available to pay for insurance.",
            "This is a very expensive proposition. The individual mandate will be a powerful incentive for the newly legalized immigrants to obtain health insurance, and many will do so through the subsidized Obamacare marketplaces. The experience of California suggests that something like 79 percent of those getting the new\u00a0legal status will turn to the subsidized individual market for insurance, with only 21 percent receiving health insurance from an employer.",
            "Obamacare includes a health insurance premium tax credit available to households with income from one to four times the official federal poverty level. This means that the tax credit subsidies are\u00a0available to individuals earning\u00a0between $12,060 and $48,240. A family of four is eligible obtain tax credits if its income is below $98,000. It\u2019s likely that this means substantially all those legalized by the DREAM Act are eligible for subsidies. According to U.S. Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center, 68 percent of DACA program enrollees in California were low-income and eligible for California\u2019s state-run medical insurance subsidies.",
            "The median annual income of current DACA aliens is $32,000, according to an August 2017 survey by Tom Wong of UC San Diego (undertaken for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and other immigration advocacy groups). The median age is estimated to be around 25- years-old. Around a quarter of DACA aliens\u00a0have a child born in the U.S.",
            "According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a single person living in San Jose, California with an income of $32,000 would be eligible to receive\u00a0a premium tax credit of $1,048 in 2017. The numbers vary by geography because health insurance costs vary widely by geography. A single person in Brooklyn with $32,000 of income would be eligible for an annual tax credit of around $2,666. But San Jose is likely more representative due to the high concentration of DACA aliens in California. Using the San Jose figure,\u00a0current DACA aliens\u00a0alone would likely be immediately eligible for around $838.4 million in Obamacare subsidies this year.",
            "Of course, not all the DACA aliens turned Dreamers would wind up on in the Obamacare marketplace. Some would receive employer provided health insurance. According to a study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, 21 percent of those granted DACA status obtained private health insurance, most likely through their employers. Subtracting those would produce $663.3 million of Obamacare subsidies.",
            "Because DACA aliens have children and some are married, that figure does not fully account for the cost of their DREAM Act Obamacare subsidies. Add in one child for every four DACA enrolled aliens and the cost rises to $1.16\u00a0billion in tax credits. Even if we add a spouse to each DACA parent earning the same $32,000 of income (a very generous assumption), the immediate cost of Obamacare subsidies to DACA aliens\u00a0is still around $1.16 billion. If you assume that all those spouses were already Obamacare eligible (that is, are legal residents), the net increase is around $835.6 million. (Again, that\u2019s a very generous assumption; a disproportionate share of spouses of DACA aliens are likely not legal residents who could sponsor their spouse\u2019s legal residency).",
            "Over time DACA workers will see their pay rise, more will get married, and they will have more children. For purposes of forecasting the cost of amnesty, assume a\u00a0fairly\u00a0representative DACA household would be in San Jose, have $64,000 of income that rises a healthy three percent each year, and include two adults and two children. Nearly 80 percent will seek health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace, and Obamacare subsidies for these households would be around $7,073 per household in the first year.",
            "Each year, household income will likely rise but not as quickly as the cost of health insurance and therefore the cost of subsidies. According to the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of subsidies will rise an average of around seven percent each year over the cost of the next ten years, producing a cumulative rise of 84 percent. So after 10 years, the representative household would earn $83,500 and be eligible to receive an Obamacare subsidy of $8,230. Even if the cost of health insurance subsidies remained level, after 10 years, this same family of four would receive $4,477 of subsidies after ten years. To be conservative, let\u2019s put the average cost of annual subsidies at the average of the two figures: $6,354. Multiplied across 800,000 DACA households less the 21 percent expected to receive employer-based health care, the annual federal budgetary cost is around $4\u00a0billion or $40\u00a0billion over 10 years.",
            "The Dream Act of 2017, however, extends legal residency to far more aliens than the current DACA program. If we include 79 percent of the\u00a01.8 million immediately eligible, the cost would rise to $91.5\u00a0billion over a decade. Including that share of the larger 3.3 million figure would push the 10 year cost of Obamacare subsidies to the DREAM households to around $167\u00a0billion.",
            "Of course, some of that would be offset by taxes paid by the legalized workers. When the CBO looked at the 2010 Dream Act, it estimated that 1.1 million authorized residents would increase federal revenues $2.3 billion in the 2011 through 2020 period. Let\u2019s generously double that for the increased number of workers we\u2019re estimating and say they would add $5 billion. The CBO said refundable tax credits (not including Obamacare) would increase by $961 million, which we can double to $1.8 billion. Social Security and Medicare outlays would rise by a combined total of around $100 million over the period, the CBO forecast. Summing it all up, the new Dream Act would result in a net increase of federal revenue of around $400 million over the decade.",
            "This means we\u2019re looking at a budgetary cost of around $165 billion over 10 years, almost all of which would be added to federal debt. Subtract roughly $50 billion\u00a0for non-immigrant spouses who would have been covered by Obamacare anyway. That leaves us with $115 billion of federal debt over a decade from the DREAM Act.",
            "This analysis probably underestimates the budgetary cost of combining the DREAM Act with Obamacare. Under the likely scenario that DREAMer incomes are lower than those of DACA aliens, for instance, the costs would go higher. If the assumption of three percent income growth is overly generous, the costs will go higher. If DREAMer households have more than two children on average, the costs would go higher. If the cost of health insurance rises more quickly than assumed, the costs will be higher. And, most importantly, if far more aliens obtain legal status than the 3.1 million used in this analysis, costs would go higher.",
            "They might call it the DREAM Act, but in terms of the federal budget, it is a nightmare."

            "We soon learned that former Crown Prince Nayef was considerably less pleased with the new line of succession than we were led to believe. Now it seems happiness with Crown Prince Salman\u2019s ascension is mandatory because Saudi police have been staging midnight raids against his critics and holding them incommunicado in prison.",
            "\u201cOver the last week, 16 people were held, their friends, relatives, and associates said in interviews. They include prominent Islamic clerics, academics, a poet, an economist, a journalist, the head of a youth organization, at least two women and one prince, a son of a former king,\u201d the New York Times reports. Some activists in Saudi Arabia claim that at least 30 dissidents have been poached so far.",
            "According to the Times, the subjects of these raids are being held incommunicado, for an indeterminate length of time, with no formal charges filed against them or public disclosure of evidence. Critics of the arrests insist the subjects were not part of any organized plot against the government or working as agents of foreign powers.",
            "Some of them are members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia classifies as a terrorist organization, but others are not. The closest thing to an official charge was a vague statement from the State Security Directorate that it has been investigating people who are working \u201cfor the benefit of foreign parties against the security of the kingdom.\u201d",
            "The NYT helpfully notes that, in the current Saudi political climate, expressing support for the diplomatically isolated Gulf nation of Qatar is considered seditious. In fact, insufficient enthusiasm for the blockade of Qatar might be the one common thread connecting all of the individuals taken into custody during this mysterious crackdown. Another commonality is that they all seem to have used social media to irk the new Crown Prince.",
            "One of those who got the black-bag treatment, cleric Salman al-Awda, was last heard on Twitter praying for Allah to \u201charmonize the hearts\u201d of Crown Prince Salman and Qatar\u2019s emir. That was the last thing heard from him before he was arrested over the weekend and has been held incommunicado ever since. His brother Khalid promptly joined him in jail after publicly complaining about his arrest.",
            "The highest-ranking crackdown target to date is Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, whose father was king until his death in 2005. Prince Abdulaziz was initially placed under house arrest \u2014 more properly, palace arrest \u2014 after a post-Hajj meeting with Prince Salman that evidently didn\u2019t go very well. His current whereabouts are unknown. Prince Nayef, incidentally, still appears to be under some form of house arrest, although his status is remarkably nebulous for someone who used to work closely with U.S. intelligence on counterterrorism projects.",
            "Several Saudis who spoke to the New York Times expressed amazement at the crackdown, which is a marked departure from the Kingdom\u2019s usual discreet methods of chastising dissidents, particularly those with public profiles.",
            "The UK Guardian speculates that contrary to public denials, Prince Salman may be planning his ascension to the throne in the very near future \u2014 he is just 32 years old, while the current king, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is 81 \u2014 so the House of Saud is clearing the decks for his coronation.",
            "The prince is strongly associated with some of the most controversial Saudi policies, including the Qatar impasse and the war against Iranian proxies in Yemen. He\u2019s also the architect of the grand plan to make the Saudi economy less dependent on oil revenues. Not only could critics of those policies make trouble when he takes the throne, but factions loyal to former Crown Prince Nayef might interfere with the succession.",
            "A senior Saudi official told the Guardian that the crackdown \u201cneeds to be viewed through the prism of Qatar primarily,\u201d but it\u2019s also about \u201celiminating any other potential rival power bases on the home front for an eventual ascendancy to the top job.\u201d According to this source, Salman is still deeply concerned with what Nayef might do. A significant detail is that most of the arrests have been performed by a relatively new security agency that once reported directly to ousted Crown Prince Nayef, but now serves the king directly.",
            "Another intriguing clue to Salman\u2019s agenda comes from the Jerusalem Post, which relates rumors that the Saudi Crown Prince made an unprecedented secret visit to Israel this week.",
            "\u201cAs expected, news of the visit was not warmly welcomed by the Arab public,\u201d the Jerusalem Post writes stoically. If Salman becomes King and soon afterward announces a major diplomatic opening to Israel, it would certainly reshuffle the deck of Saudi politics. That could explain his sudden determination to put all the wild cards in jail for a while.",
            "The Associated Press quotes observers who believe the crackdown is part of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan to socially liberate the Kingdom\u2019s oppressive Islamic society, acting under the tutelage of his close friend Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.",
            "According to this analysis, the United Arab Emirates are the tourist-friendly Disneyland of the Islamic Middle East, and Crown Prince Salman\u2019s vision of foreign investment calls for a more inviting Saudi Arabia, remodeled along UAE lines. Publicity photos MBS, as he\u2019s widely known, make him look like he\u2019s trying to shake hands with the entire world at once and invite everyone to Riyadh for lunch. If the planned sale of stock in Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company goes well, he might be able to afford that.",
            "An alternative interpretation offered by the AP is that MBS ordered the arrests to appease hardline Wahhabi clerics, not intimidate them. From this perspective, Salman is making a bid to reassure them that modernization of Saudi trade and infrastructure will not provoke a liberal social revolution because the new King will maintain a strong hand in guiding society.",
            "The most interesting question about the sudden Saudi crackdown on dissidents is whether it represents strength or weakness on the part of the monarchy. The Associated Press judges that the arrests have \u201cthrown an already anxious kingdom into deeper unease,\u201d with apprehension mounting that MBS\u2019s ascension to the throne might not be as popular as originally anticipated.",
            "Naturally, human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch denounced the crackdown. \u201cIn recent years we cannot recall a week in which so many prominent Saudi Arabian figures have been targeted in such a short space of time. It is clear that the new leadership under Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is sending a chilling message: freedom of expression will not be tolerated, we are coming after you,\u201d said Samah Hadid of Amnesty International.",
            "In the long term, it may prove to be a more difficult situation to evaluate from a human rights standpoint if MBS\u2019s ultimate objective is to liberalize Saudi Arabia, and he\u2019s working on consolidating the power he needs to do it. The pessimistic view is that very few liberalization movements have begun with midnight raids, arrests without charges, and incommunicado detention."

        "header": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively in an interview in his U.S. Senate office on Capitol Hill this week that he is troubled by the bad advice President Donald Trump is getting from the military generals who surround him on matters of war.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "\u201cI think the president\u2019s instincts, his instinct as he said the other day was to end the Afghan war and not to get more involved,\u201d Paul told Breitbart News. \u201cHis instinct all along has been that the Iraq war was a mistake, and he\u2019s said the same thing recently about the Afghan war. I think he still believes that, but I think the problem is he\u2019s surrounded by people who talk in his ear that are from the military who all think it is a military solution. I just think that a war for the country of Afghanistan is not winnable because Afghanistan is not really a country; it\u2019s a bunch of different tribes and they don\u2019t really want to be a country. They\u2019re only a country because the West drew a circle around them and said \u2018hey, you\u2019re Afghanistan. You\u2019re a country.\u2019 But they never really were, historically, a country.\u201d",
            "Trump, of course, broke a campaign promise recently by pledging a troop surge in Afghanistan\u2014after campaigning all last year to end the war. Paul believes that Trump should stop trusting those who are biased on the issue in his inner circle, and go back to his \u201cinstincts\u201d that he campaigned on last year.",
            "\u201cI think that we can hope that the president will go back to his instincts, and hire people around him who\u2014I think he\u2019s getting all one-sided advice right now and he\u2019s not hearing from people who were on the campaign with him, who heard him say thousands and thousands of times that \u2018we\u2019re going to build things at home, we\u2019re going to take care of our people first, we\u2019re going to take care of America first. We\u2019re going to rebuild our roads and bridges here at home,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons he got elected\u2014he told people he would take care of the people at home here in America, and that America would be first before Afghanistan, first before all the money we spend overseas. I think he still believes that. It\u2019s just a matter of, I think, his supporters need to be loud and remind him of what he said and see if we can get him to harken back to it. But in Congress we have our own responsibility to try to assert ourselves and say \u2018hey, we need to be involved in this war-making power.\u2019\u201d",
            "While Paul did not name National Security Adviser three-star Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, White House chief of staff retired four-star Marine Gen. John Kelly, and Defense Secretary and retired Marine Gen. James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis\u2014among others\u2014that is obviously to whom he was referring. Those officials\u2014among others\u2014were pushing for a troop surge. Trump\u2019s now former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who has returned to Breitbart News as Executive Chairman, and Dr. Sebastian Gorka\u2014who has also left the White House\u2014were among those pushing for the president to follow through on his campaign promises on Afghanistan. Instead of following through on his promise to end the war that has now spanned nearly all of three administrations, Trump re-upped on the Afghan war last month by pledging to surge U.S. forces yet again despite the more than 15 years of U.S. setbacks and lack of an end in sight.",
            "Paul\u2019s interview with Breitbart News came as the U.S. Senate was voting on his resolution on an authorization for the use of military force, AUMF, in Afghanistan. The Congress has not approved an AUMF for Afghanistan in more than a decade, since the beginning of the George W. Bush administration when the war began.",
            "\u201cI think that the majority of the Senate, the majority of the Congress, will say that they believe Congress ought to vote to authorize war,\u201d\u00a0 But really, their actions don\u2019t express that they really truly believe that. There\u2019s a big group of the neo-cons and the neo-liberals who believe that the president can do whatever he wants, and most presidents also believe they can do whatever they want\u2014that Article II of the Constitution says they can do whatever they want. So, they all profess that we should have a [authorization of] use of [military] force, a new one, but they aren\u2019t willing to vote for anything that would force that to happen. So, I think it\u2019s easy to have the status quo\u2014and the status quo is if people get unhappy with the war, they say \u2018hey we didn\u2019t vote for it, it\u2019s the president doing this.\u2019 And if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat, they get to point and say \u2018hey it\u2019s their fault not our fault.\u2019\u201d",
            "Paul\u2019s resolution\u2014which came as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)\u2014failed by a vote of 61-36 in the Senate this week. But the fact that 36 senators voted with him, he says, is progress in the right direction.",
            "\u201cI think showing persistent philosophical desire that we do the right thing, I think some of them even though they disagreed with me, some of them thought it was the right thing that we had the debate and the vote,\u201d Paul said when Breitbart News asked how he got Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on this. \u201cThen, I think it\u2019s also, being an individual senator and being persistent and using the rules to gum the system up and then saying \u2018but I\u2019ll gladly stand aside if you allow a vote on this issue that is very important to me.\u2019 But I think even most who disagreed with me thought I was sincere in believing that this was a constitutional question we should address.\u201d",
            "Paul said the pathway forward for those who don\u2019t want endless wars, and want Congress to reassert its authority over the executive branch when it comes to war power, is to keep fighting and forcing the debate.",
            "\u201cThere have been people, they pushed a resolution that passed in committee to sunset these authorizations of use of force in the House as well,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had the vote here as well. I think we keep agitating, and pointing out that \u2018look, Obama couldn\u2019t win the war with 100,000 troops. And we\u2019re going to do it with 15,000?\u2019 I think that argument is a pretty powerful one.\u201d",
            "Paul added that it was former President Barack Obama who was the worst U.S. president in history for checks and balances on executive branch war authority.",
            "\u201cI would say President Obama expanded the idea of presidents acting unilaterally more than any president in history,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of, I think, intriguing because the left always criticized George Bush for the Iraq war. And yet George Bush at least came to Congress and asked for permission to go to war in Iraq. President Obama didn\u2019t ask for permission. He bombed seven different countries and didn\u2019t ask for permission once. He thought about asking for permission once, and thought we might beat him and then didn\u2019t ask. So, no, President Obama, I think, was bad for the country in the sense that he greatly expanded the war-making power of the president. And, we still live under that sort of idea now\u2014it\u2019s just continued and continued. But, it\u2019s really Republicans and Democrats who have failed to stand up and assert themselves and say this is a correct congressional prerogative.\u201d",
            "Paul also told Breitbart News that \u201cyes,\u201d he supports a bipartisan effort in the House by Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI) and Mark Pocan (D-WI) and others to force the Trump administration to seek congressional approval\u00a0on United States involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s war with Yemen, which started under President Obama.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a big debate we ought to be having,\u201d Paul said regarding the Yemen controversy. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole new separate war, it\u2019s not connected to any of the other wars. And I think there is a strong argument to be made that if we further the chaos in Yemen and we take one side against another, we make it to such an extent that a vacuum develops and Al Qaeda steps into that vacuum. I think there\u2019s a chance. One, it\u2019s not our war. We should vote on it, and there\u2019s not a vital interest. But, two, whatever we do may do the opposite of what we want and may allow Al Qaeda to grow stronger. I think our involvement in Syria allowed a power vacuum to develop and it allowed ISIS to grow stronger\u2014because of our presence in Syria.\u201d",

        "paragraphs": [
            "A new policy,\u00a0established by Elliot School of International Affairs Dean Reuben Brigety on July 1, requires that all multi-speaker events with at least three speakers feature at least one female panelist. If all panelists are male, the moderator must be female. The event could be canceled by the administrators if these conditions are not met.",
            "\u201cFor any panel, symposium, or multi-speaker event (3 or more speakers) held at the Elliott School, there should be no single-gender discussion panels,\u201d Elliott School Dean Reuben Brigety wrote in an email.",
            "\u201cIf a panel consists of a single-gender [sic], please ensure that the moderator is of a different gender,\u201d said Brigety, adding: \u201cNon-adherence to this policy could result in cancellation of the event.\u201d",
            "George Washington Law School Professor John Banzhaf, who isn\u2019t affected directly by the policy, claims that the new rule \u201cflies in the face of academic freedom \u2013 including clear explanations and robust discussions of important topics by those most qualified in various areas \u2013 as well as GWU\u2019s strong equal opportunity policy statement which restricts discrimination based upon sex as well as many other factors,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
            "\u201cEven if there is absolutely no sex discrimination whatsoever, and people are assigned to panels completely by chance, there will still be many panels which will be all-male (and therefore subject to being prohibited), just as there will be some all female panels,\u201d he added.",
            "This new policy brings into memory an incident that occurred at the University of Southern California in 2016.\u00a0A panel for video game design students at the University of Southern California featuring leaders in the industry was canceled after administrators decided that the event\u2019s all-male panel was not diverse enough. Some students complained that the decision only served to hurt female students who would have benefited from the opportunity to network with industry leaders."

        "paragraphs": [
            "Around 4 p.m. (CDT), police escorted a heavy-duty Terex crane into Robert E. Lee Park in uptown Dallas. Teams of workers toiled for at least three hours to cut underneath the statue\u2019s base. Using a power saw and a crowbar, they dislodged the 14-foot tall, six-ton equestrian bronze statue depicting Lee and an unknown Confederate soldier from its stone pedestal. As they did, crowds of locals grew, many snapping photos with their cell phones. Police surrounded the area.",
            "Minutes before 7 p.m. workers hoisted the statue onto a flatbed trailer and transported it to Hensley Air Field, a city-owned storage facility. The statue, dedicated in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of the Texas Centennial, will remain shuttered until an appointed 20-person Confederate task force figures out what to do with it.",
            "In mid-August, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings announced the formation of the task force in response to violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia, protest. He charged appointees with developing solutions over a three-month period, later advising elected officials on whether or not to remove Confederate monuments.\u00a0Days\u00a0later, the mayor, who called the statues \u201cdangerous totems\u201d and \u201cmonuments of propaganda,\u201d\u00a0sped up the process. He changed the date council members would vote on task force findings to November 8.",
            "Then, on\u00a0August 28,\u00a0three of the four black council members suddenly\u00a0submitted\u00a0a resolution to the city, demanding the immediate removal, disposal and\/or relocation of all Confederate monuments located on Dallas public land. The document\u00a0also commanded renaming\u00a0public parks and streets with any ties to the Old South. It asserted that\u00a0Confederate figures and symbols \u201cpreserve the principles of white supremacy.\u201d The resolution altered\u00a0the roles of task force appointees, too.\u00a0Council members no longer required input on the sculptures\u2019 fates. They wanted suggestions on costs and where to store or relocate downed monuments. Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway, who previously voiced support for Rawlings\u2019 90-day process, led\u00a0the resolution revolution, bumping up the November 8 vote to September 6. The task force met for the first time on August 31.",
            "Last Wednesday, Dallas council members passed\u00a0the resolution 13-1 with one abstention. Within hours, crews began removing the statue until\u00a0a federal judge stopped them\u00a0with a temporary restraining order (TRO).\u00a0Dallas resident Hiram Patterson and the Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans filed a lawsuit against the city\u00a0freezing the statue\u2019s removal.\u00a0The next day, though, the judge dissolved the TRO. He said the plaintiff failed to show it would likely succeed if the case proceeded, a requirement to keep a TRO in place,\u00a0according to\u00a0WFAA.",
            "This cleared the way for Dallas city officials to remove Lee\u2019s statue. On Sunday evening, an 18-wheeler carried a crane in from Houston. Tragically, a freeway crash killed the tractor-trailer driver and damaged\u00a0the crane.\u00a0The Dallas Morning News\u00a0noted\u00a0the difficulty of finding another crane capable of moving the massive metal structure as most machinery remained in Houston to aid Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts.",
            "Caraway initially\u00a0estimated\u00a0removal and storage costs for two Confederate monuments at $4 million funded by \u201cexcess revenue.\u201d The price tag on Lee\u2019s likeness has fluctuated from $600,000 to $400,000 and back up to $500,000.",
            "Beyond public comments at last week\u2019s city council meeting, it appears Dallas taxpayers have had little formal input on this issue. A recent NBC DFW poll showed\u00a079 percent of respondents opposed removing Lee\u2019s statue. Only 21 percent agreed. The Dallas newspaper surveyed 503 registered city voters. Only 29 percent called for statue removal. Fifty-seven percent preferred a fictitious alternative plan where statues stayed beefed up by historical facts.",
            "A rally scheduled Saturday to\u00a0\u201cSave the Monument\u201d will continue as planned at Lee Park.\u00a0This is Texas Freedom Force (TITFF), a group \u201ccommitted to protecting Texas and Texas history\u201d organized the event. They have staged similar rallies across the state. Their president, Robert Beverly, told Breitbart Texas, \u201cWe are going to demand the statue be returned.\u201d",
            "Beverly is a native Texan, a U.S. military veteran, a graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington, and an area business owner. He believes\u00a0the city\u2019s decision to remove Lee\u2019s statue was largely political, questioning why no brouhaha erupted out of City Hall over a downtown Fair Park statue of R.L. Thornton, a past Democrat Dallas mayor and a prominent Ku Klux Klan figure.",

He kept complimenting me, something came up about my not having a boyfriend, and he stopped me in front of the hotel and kissed me. I think he stopped and kissed me a few times. I was VERY drunk, so I can\u2019t say it was entirely consensual. I know I wanted out of the situation\u2026 Something finally came to in my brain and I politely excused myself, pointing out he had a girlfriend and it was not something I would do.\u201d",

I count myself lucky I wasn\u2019t subjected to the more violent harassment he laid on other women.\u201d",

This is not a man who told an offensive joke on Twitter, momentarily lost his temper on Facebook, or said something stupid in the heat of a cable news debate. Faraci is a world-class S.O.B. who would have danced on the grave of any professional career he destroyed. Moreover, his alleged misconduct is objectively monstrous.",
